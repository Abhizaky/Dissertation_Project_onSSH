    "## What is Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content (like text, images, audio, or video) from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML offers a new way to solve problems, answer complex questions, and create new content. ML can predict the weather, estimate travel times, recommend songs, auto-complete sentences, summarize articles, and generate never-seen-before images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we wanted to create an app to predict rainfall. We could use either a traditional approach or an ML approach. Using a traditional approach, we'd create a physics-based representation of the Earth's atmosphere and surface, computing massive amounts of fluid dynamics equations. This is incredibly difficult.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using an ML approach, we would give an ML model enormous amounts of weather data until the ML model eventually learned the mathematical relationship between weather patterns that produce differing amounts of rain. We would then give the model the current weather data, and it would predict the amount of rai\n",

    "##\r\n",
    "## 1. Supervised Learning\r\n",
    "- The model is trained on a labeled dataset.\r\n",
    "- It learns to map inputs to known outputs.\r\n",
    "- Example: Predicting house prices based on histdataal da##ta.\r\n",

    "## 2. Unsupervised Learning\r\n",

    "- It identifies patterns or groupings within the dataset.\r\n",
    "- Example: Customer segmentation using clustering alg##orithms.\r\n",

    "## 3. Reinforcement Learning\r\n",
    "- The model learns by interacting with an environment.\r\n",
    "- It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\r\n",
    "- Example: Training a robot to walk or an AI t##o play chess.\r\n",
